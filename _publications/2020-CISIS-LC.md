excerpt: 'A simple algorithm to compute the linear complexity of binary sequences with period a power of 2 has been proposed. The algorithm exploits the fractal structure of the binomial representation in this kind of binary sequences. The application of the general algorithm to a particular family of cryptographic sequences (generalized sequences) improves its performance as decreases the amount of sequence to be processed. '
