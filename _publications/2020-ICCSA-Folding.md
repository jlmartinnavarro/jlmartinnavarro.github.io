title: "Folding-BSD Algorithm for Binary Sequence Decomposition"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-ICCSA-Folding
excerpt: 'The IoT revolution leads to a range of critical services which rely on IoT devices. Nevertheless, they often lack proper security, becoming the gateway to attack the whole system. IoT security protocols often rely on stream ciphers, where PRNGs are an essential part of them. In this article, a family of ciphers with strong characteristics that make them difficult to be analyzed by standard methods is described. In addition, we will discuss an innovative technique of sequence decomposition and present a novel algorithm to evaluate the strength of binary sequences, key part of the IoT security stack.'
